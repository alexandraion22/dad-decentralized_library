The Last Theorem

Integer iaculis mauris nec eros pretium, in egestas erat finibus. Vivamus consectetur, velit at condimentum tincidunt, nulla magna aliquet enim, vel cursus enim ipsum a nisl. Morbi semper, libero quis interdum ullamcorper, eros ex fermentum mi, vel pellentesque enim justo at tortor. Nullam id commodo nibh. Sed ut pellentesque sapien, non lacinia quam. 

Cras id arcu vel neque feugiat ullamcorper. Vivamus fringilla nisl in turpis vulputate, sit amet tempus tortor venenatis. Nulla facilisi. Integer tincidunt feugiat nisi, quis tristique nunc euismod ac. Phasellus pharetra magna eget metus efficitur, vel luctus velit tristique. Nam elementum, enim a volutpat eleifend, nunc purus tincidunt nulla, at tincidunt metus metus id sem.

Professor Thomas Harrington has spent his entire career trying to solve the infamous Zhang-Yau conjecture that has stumped mathematicians for decades. As he nears retirement, a brilliant young graduate student brings him a novel approach that might finally lead to a breakthrough. Their collaboration takes them through the elegant world of number theory and topology, but academic rivals and internal doubts threaten to derail their work. In a race against time and mathematical impossibility, they push toward what could be the last great theorem of Harrington's career.
